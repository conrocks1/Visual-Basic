Online Voting System created using ASP.NET MVC and C#

It took me two weeks to build this website. I am familiar to ASP.NET, but not MVC. Thanks to Microsoft for providing the videos from Plural sight for free of cost, that helped me learn about it. Also, I learnt C#, along the way :)

Also, this uses LINQ for making connection with SQL databases and it's a very cool one.
