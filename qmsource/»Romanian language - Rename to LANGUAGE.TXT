THIS FILE ALLOWS YOU TO DISPLAY ALTERNATE
LANGUAGES FOR ALL OF QUICK MIXER'S TEXT!
-----------------------------------------

V E R Y   I M P O R T A N T   T I P S . . .

This will only work for languages which can
be displayed with the 'MS Sans Serif' font,
or it's replacement on your system.

REPLACE ONLY THE TEXT INSIDE THE BRACKET
CHARACHTERS {} WITH TEXT IN THE LANGUAGE
WHICH YOU DESIRE!!!  EDIT NO OTHER TEXT!!!

DO NOT DELETE THE BRACKETS! {} THEY MUST STAY!                   

Keep your translations short!  If they are
too long, they will not display correctly.
CRITICAL ENTRIES CANNOT BE MUCH LONGER THAN
ENGLISH ENTRIES AND ARE MARKED (*)

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you use a PLAIN-TEXT
editor like Notepad! DON'T use Write or Wordpad!
Saving with anything other than a PLAIN-TEXT
editor will RUIN this file!!!

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you edit ONLY what is
INSIDE the bracket {} charachters!!! CRUCIAL!!!

Do NOT add any carriage returns and do NOT
delete any lines or this file will NOT work!!! 

Do NOT use any commas(,), colons(:), semi-
colons(;), pipes(|), quotation marks("), 
ampersans(&), or ANY OTHER line-seperators
or this file will NOT work!!!

You can include ONE '@' character in your
prompts before the charachter you would like
underlined, but be careful they don't conflict
in the same level.  These indicate keyboard
shortcuts. ONLY use one IF there is one in
the English version on the left of the = sign.

For this file to cause Quick Mixer to display
it's contents, this file  must be renamed to
